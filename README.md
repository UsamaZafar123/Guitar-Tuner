# Guitar-Tuner
Create a system that could analyze an audio signal from a guitar, in this case from a mp3 file. To implement it, I will use IIR2 and FFT due to the consideration that it is the simplest way to obtain the pitch. The system has to display to the user if the guitar is tuned or if it is out of tone. To represent the application done, I will use the matlab GUI interface.

GUITAR TUNER

- Introduction
In music, an electronic tuner is a device that detects and displays the pitch of musical notes. Simple tuners indicate, typically with a needle-dial, LED, or LCD whether a pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. In this case, I will do a software application.
I think that it is a good form to practice my knowledge acquired in the MAE subject and do an application or program with a good functionality.
